# Personalized-Product-Recommendation

This project focuses on creating a personalized product recommendation system using Python, with a core emphasis on machine learning through TensorFlow. The process involves the loading and merging of user and product data from CSV files, followed by transforming categorical interaction types into numerical values for model compatibility. The heart of the system lies in a neural network model constructed with TensorFlow, featuring embedding layers, dense layers, and softmax activation to predict user preferences.

Through training on user-product interaction data, the model learns to generate recommendations tailored to individual users. These recommendations are further refined by incorporating key factors such as product popularity, date of interaction, and price. The goal is to provide users with a curated shopping experience, where suggested products align closely with their historical preferences and behavior.

To enhance user interaction, the project integrates features for handling user input, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly interface. This approach contributes to an interactive and dynamic recommendation system that adapts to the evolving preferences of users, ultimately optimizing their shopping experience.
